Create Your Own Exchange
Written by Daniel Pyrathon, the 0x team, and Simon Zirui Guo.

Prerequisites
Before the lecture, please do the following:

Install Metamask (on Chrome) and create a new account (optionally, re-use an existing account)
Install VSCode (Will make programming in TypeScript much easier)
Important! Mint some KETH by using the faucet, or by pasting your address in the Kovan Gitter, please ensure that you have at least 1-2 ETH.
Install NodeJS, preferably v10.15.3 or higher. If you use Linux as an OS, please ensure that your NodeJS has all the shared libraries, compilers, in order to install packages with native C code.
Revise ERC20 token allowances
Register for an Infura account (free)
Make sure you are comfortable working with JavaScript. You should be familiar with concepts such as promises, async/await syntax, anonymous functions (or callbacks)
Optional: Learn the basics of TypeScript
Homework Detail
In this homework, you will build your own DeFi application, which is an exchange that uses 0x API to easily swap between DAI and USDC.

Proceed to this repo and clone it to get started. Shout out to Daniel Pyrathon and the 0x team for creating this coding assignment.

Before you proceed, we highly recommend you watch the lecture recording of the technical walkthrough.

Check Off
Email us a screenshot of your exchange web app after successfully swapping DAI and USDC. It should look something like this.

Demo of the Web App

In addition, please send us a screenshot of your MetaMask. It should look like something like this.
